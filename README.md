This is a chrome browser extension that computes core pivotal authorship metrics on a google scholar page. It is adapted, poorly, from the GScholarLens package which computes the sh-index (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04124). 

## Installation

While I am working on a submission to the chrome web store, please follow these instructions:

(1) Download the extension  
  ```wget https://github.com/russcd/corePivotal/raw/refs/heads/main/corePivotal_0.1.0.zip```  
(2) Navigate to chrome://extensions.  
(3) Turn on developer mode in the top right corner.  
(4) Select load unpacked and select the unzipped extension folder.  
(5) Then navigate to a google scholar page and the core pivotal button should appear.
